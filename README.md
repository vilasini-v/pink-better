# better but pink

Hello!! this project is quite special to me, because well, I did it just to fit my needs or what I needed in an app. + the app is completely pink, which unsurprisingly is my favourite colour :3 
A release will be available for the same app. Commits and pull requests are encouraged! <3

The project was built with flutter and contains 2 screens.
1. A simple notes page - which has a folder functionality to organise my notes better.
2. Weekly planner - where one can add tasks with dates and can view tasks for the day.
